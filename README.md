## 🤔 Why?

I created this repo for 3 main reasons:
1.  Basketball is my favourite sport.
2.  The final report included in this repo was an assignment for a Coursera project so I thought I might as well share it with the rest of the world.
3.  To showcase my Data Science skills, specifically Exploratory Data Analysis and knowledge of Unsupervised Learning algorithms.

## 🤗 What can you do?

I would love for you to read the analysis and discover more about legendary basketball players, their stats, and how they compare to on another.

I would really appreciate it if you could give me feedback on what I can improve in the report. To send me feedback, you can either create a new Issue in the repo, or email me at raj.pulapakura@gmail.com
